## üß™ API Testing with Postman

You can test all endpoints using Postman:

1. Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
2. Create a new request collection
3. Use the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint         | Description             |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/books`     | Get all books           |
| GET    | `/api/books/:id` | Get one book by ID      |
| POST   | `/api/books`     | Add a new book          |
| PUT    | `/api/books/:id` | Update an existing book |
| DELETE | `/api/books/:id` | Delete a book           |

#### Example JSON body for `POST` and `PUT`:

```json
{
  "title": "The Hobbit",
  "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
  "year": "1937",
  "genre": "Fantasy"
}
```

‚úÖ Tip: Set `Content-Type` header to `application/json` in Postman when sending POST/PUT requests.
